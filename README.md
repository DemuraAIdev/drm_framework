# DRM

DRM Is Mini framwork
DRM is NOT a professional framework and it does not come with all the stuff real frameworks have

## Features

- simple, easy to understand
- simple but clean structure
- makes "beautiful" clean URLs
- demo CRUD actions: Create, Read, Update and Delete database entries easily (ON PROJECT)
- tries to follow PSR 1/2 coding guidelines
- uses PDO for any database requests, comes with an additional PDO debug tool to emulate your SQL statements
- uses only native PHP code, so people don't have to learn a framework

## Requirements

- PHP 7.2.0+ (when first released), now it works fine with current stable versions PHP 5.6 and 7.1, 7.2., 7.3 and 7.4. 
  The latest PHP 8.0 is not tested yet but should also work fine.
- MySQL
