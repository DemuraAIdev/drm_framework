# DRM 

DRM Is Mini framwork
DRM is NOT a professional framework and it does not come with all the stuff real frameworks have

## Features

- simple, easy to understand
- With [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com), [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/start), [AnimateJS](https://animejs.com/)
- simple but clean structure
- makes "beautiful" clean URLs
- demo CRUD actions: Create, Read, Update and Delete database entries easily (ON PROJECT)
- tries to follow PSR 1/2 coding guidelines
- uses PDO for any database requests, comes with an additional PDO debug tool to emulate your SQL statements
- uses only native PHP code, so people don't have to learn a framework
- DRM Manage Config Version and More (Cooming soon)

## Requirements

- PHP 7.2.0+ (when first released), now it works fine with current stable versions PHP 5.6 and 7.1, 7.2., 7.3 and 7.4. 
  The latest PHP 8.0 is not tested yet but should also work fine.
- MySQL

## Manual Installation
1. Edit the database credentials in `system/config/config.php`
2. Execute the .sql statements in the `user_absen.sql`-folder (with PHPMyAdmin for example).
3. Make sure you have mod_rewrite activated on your server / in your environment. Some guidelines:
   [EasyPHP on Windows](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8158770/easyphp-and-htaccess),
   [AMPPS on Windows/Mac OS](http://www.softaculous.com/board/index.php?tid=3634&title=AMPPS_rewrite_enable/disable_option%3F_please%3F),
   [XAMPP for Windows](http://www.leonardaustin.com/blog/technical/enable-mod_rewrite-in-xampp/),
   [MAMP on Mac OS](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7670561/how-to-get-htaccess-to-work-on-mamp)

4. Install composer and run `composer install` in the project's folder to create the PSR-4 autoloading stuff from Composer automatically.

## CSS & JS

### Bootstrap
Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It contains CSS- and (optionally) JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components. 

### Fontawesome
Font Awesome is a font and icon toolkit based on CSS and Less. It was made by Dave Gandy for use with Bootstrap, and later was incorporated into the BootstrapCDN. Font Awesome has a reported 38% market share among those websites that use third-party font scripts on their platform, ranking it second place after Google Fonts.[2] 

### Anime.js
Anime.js (/ˈæn.ə.meɪ/) is a lightweight JavaScript animation library with a simple, yet powerful API.
It works with CSS properties, SVG, DOM attributes and JavaScript Objects.
